Project structure:

   src/


      main/


          java/


              --here you have classes for process and store data, and defined API to show the data


      test/


          java/


              --here you have test classes for reading data, invoke methods from the ‘main’ classes with data -> read from DB -> validate results


P.S. We’ll take a look at every single class
☺


P.P.S. Do not reinvent the wheel.


P.P.P.S. Do not spend time on complex processing logic, please.



Best regards
